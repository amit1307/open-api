# Model

This is a Java representation of the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#specification).

## To Do

* Should we use a custom implementation that returns an `Optional` or should we pass `Optional` to the record or should we leave it this way ?

* What should be done with [Specification Extensions](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#specificationExtensions) ?

* Should we continue using the [Bean Validation API](https://beanvalidation.org/) ?
